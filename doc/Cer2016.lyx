Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction of phylogenies has proven invaluable in answering evolutionary
 biological questions.
 Our current phylogenetic tools ignore the fact that speciation takes time,
 which has an effect unknown in phylogeny reconstruction.
 Here, we measure the errors that the Bayesian phylogenetic software tool
 BEAST2 gives when recovering simulated phylogenies, for different times-to-spec
iate, under a range of additional parameter settings.
 It has been found that branch lengths are consistently and strongly underestima
ted for biologically relevant parameters.
 This research shows that protractedness is a complexity of nature that
 should not be ignored and should be incorporated in our phylogenetic tools.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Speciation takes time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we know that speciation takes time, we commonly ignore this when
 constructing a phylogeny, by chosing a constant-rate birth-death model
 as a speciation model.
 The constant-rate birth-death model (as described in for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nee1994"

\end_inset

) is among the simplest speciation models, and assumes instant speciation
 and extinction rates, captured by its two parameters.
 The constant-rate birth-death model is popular for its simplicity, yet
 has also served as a starting point for more elaborate specation models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other speciation models may assume that speciation rate changes in time
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, is dependent on the amount of species present 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or is trait dependent

.
 The original model by making speciation rate dependent on time, diversity
 or trait value.
 Also these extended models assume speciation is instantaneous.

Protracted speciation model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protracted speciation model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rosindell2010protracted"

\end_inset

 allows for speciation taking time.
 It adds an additional species state (see also figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-states-and-transitions-of-a-species"

\end_inset

): the 'incipient' stage, which a lineages has to complete before becoming
 a 'good' species.
 The protracted speciation model makes no assumption about the exact biolologica
l mechanism by which reproductive isolation is acquired 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "etienne2012prolonging,etienne2014estimating,rosindell2010protracted"

\end_inset

, yet matches best to the peripatric mode of speciation, in which species
 occupy a new niche, without gene flow between parental and this incipient
 species.
 The protracted speciation model makes no assumption about speciation and
 extinction rates (these may be contant or depend on time, diversity or
 trait value), but these features can easily be added to the model.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Use of a speciation model in inferring a phylogeny
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speciation models are widely used to make inferences from genetic data.
 There are multiple computer programs to create phylogenies and/or parameter
 estimates from aligned DNA sequences.
 BEAST2 is a widely used tool that allows for a Bayesian approach to phylogeneti
cs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 BEAST2 supplies the user with multiple speciation models, that all assume
 instantaneous speciation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
This study
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This simulation investigates the consequence of BEAST2 using instantaneous
 speciation, by creating a 'true' tree that is protracted and seeing how
 well BEAST2 can recover it.
 It is expected that for higher protractedness (thus deviation from BEAST2
 its assumptions), the error will increase.
 It is unknown, however, if and when this error is relevant.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speciation model used in this investigation is a constant-rate protracted
 speciation model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A protracted speciation model assumes that species have at least two states:
 a species is either a good or incipient species.
 A good species is a species recognized as such, where an incipient species
 is not yet.
 Both good and incipient species can generate new incipient species, at
 the speciation-initiation rates 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{g}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 An incipient species can become a good species at the speciation-completion
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Both good and incipient species can go extinct at rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{g}$
\end_inset

 respectively (see also figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-states-and-transitions-of-a-species"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest member of the protracted speciation famility is the constant-rate
 protracted speciation model, which assumes that all rates are constant
 in time.

Speciation-completion rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speciation-completion rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is pivotal for this study, as when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 the model falls back to a birth-death model and satisfies the instantaneous
 speciation assumption of the tools used.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Speciation initiation rate, extinction rate and crown age
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameter values for the speciation-initiation rates 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, extinction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and phylogeny crown age 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}$
\end_inset

 need to be balanced, as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}b\gg\mu$
\end_inset

 results in overly taxon-rich phylogenies, where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}\mu\gg b$
\end_inset

 results in extinction of all lineages.
 As a starting point, we used the parameters used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "etienne2014estimating"

\end_inset

.
 For simplicity, we assume species can give rise to new species, independent
 of species status, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}=b_{g}$
\end_inset

.
 This assumes that speciation is caused mostly by vicariance and the accumulatio
n of independent mutations.
 Additionally, we assume a species can go extinct independent of species
 status, so
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}=\mu_{g}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Creating species trees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A species tree is a phylogeny with one lineage per species.
 Assuming instantaneous speciation, every lineage represents a species per
 definition.
 For protracted speciation one needs to define which subspecies is chosen
 to represent a species.
 One such way is to randomly sample one lineage per species.
 For the sampling being representative, this approach would have to be repeated
 multiple times, which is computationally infeasable.
 Instead, we chose (non-randomly) the two most extreme species trees: of
 each species, we pick the lineages that has been present longest (the oldest)
 and shortest (the youngest)

 As a starting point, we chose the DNA sequence length to be 1kb, as this
 a common gene sequence length, but we also included one and two orders
 of magnitude bigger.
 The mutation rate is chosen to match a mutation rate as in nature [TODO:

The protracted speciation model creates trees with less taxa, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A constant-rate protracted birth-death model is used, this research could
 easily be modified to compare other protracted birth-death models, for
 example, a diversity-dependent protracted birth-death model.
 There has been now work done on the diversity-dependent protracted birth-deatg
 model yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research assumes that speciation is allopatric, because in the simulation
 of the DNA alignments, there is no gene flow anymore between two taxa of
 still-the-same species.
