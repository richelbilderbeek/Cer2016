Suppose a 3D matrix:

```{r}
m <- array(1:8, c(2, 2, 2))
```

Let's say I want the 2nd columns of the second depth.

Here, `lintr` will complain about the presence of a 
space before the comma before the second `2`:

```{r}
a <- m[2, , 2] 
```

Here, `lintr` will complain about the space absent after the comma of
the first `2`:

```{r}
b <- m[2,, 2] 
```

```{r}
lintr::lint("bug_report_lintr.Rmd")
```

After an update by @jimhester, now `a` is the preferred way.
