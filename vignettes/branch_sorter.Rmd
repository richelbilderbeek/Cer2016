## loading required packages
```{r}
library(ape)
library(Cer2016)
```

## generating a tree
```{r}
tree1 <- rtree(3)
plot(tree1)
```
We've got a tree. It's even got some info about itself in a file, which we'll 
need later.

```{r}
names(tree1)
```

## comparing the tree to itself.
We want to compare it to itself, so we duplicate it.

```{r}
tree2 <- tree1
```
