This document shows some work-out examples.

These worked-out examples show:

  * the error if protractedness is absent
  * the error if protractedness strong
  * comparing these errors
  * the error if protractedness is absent for multiple replicates
  * the error if protractedness is strong for multiple replicates
  * comparing these errors

## Workflow

Every experiment has the following steps:

 * Starting up
 * Creating parameter files
 * Per parameter file:
   * Simulate one incipient species tree per parameter file
   * Once or more often, sample unique species from an incipient species tree
   * Per sampled species tree, add an outgroup
   * Simulate one or more alignments per species tree
   * Once or more often, let BEAST2 infer a posterior per alignment
   * Compare original, sampled species tree, to the posterior
 * Per two parameter files:
   * Compare original, sampled species tree, to the posterior

## Starting up

We will need to load some libraries:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ape)
library(Cer2016)
library(ggplot2)
library(Hmisc)
library(nLTT)
library(ribir)
library(phangorn)
```

We also set the resolution of our analysis:

```{r}
dt <- 0.001
```

I use `0.1` while developing code, 
`0.001` for a decent analysis.

## Creating parameter files

This worked-out example will show:

  * the error if protractedness is absent
  * the error if protractedness strong
  * comparing these errors
  * the error if protractedness is absent for multiple replicates
  * the error if protractedness is strong for multiple replicates
  * comparing these errors

For that, I will create four parameter files:

  * `toy_example_1.RDa`: protractedness is absent
  * `toy_example_2.RDa`: protractedness strong
  * `toy_example_3.RDa`: protractedness is absent for multiple replicates
  * `toy_example_4.RDa`: protractedness is strong for multiple replicates

Here the parameter files are created with the desired parameters:

```{r create_parameter_files}
filenames <- create_parameter_files_toy_examples()
```

  * `toy_example_1.RDa`: protractedness is absent, thus speciation completion rate is high, in this case `1.0e6`
  * `toy_example_2.RDa`: protractedness strong, thus speciation completion rate is low, inde this case `1.0e-1`
  * `toy_example_3.RDa`: protractedness is absent for multiple replicates, thus number of sampled species trees, alignments per species trees, and BEAST2 runs are all 2
  * `toy_example_4.RDa`: protractedness is strong for multiple replicates,  thus number of sampled species trees, alignments per species trees, and   BEAST2 runs are all 2
  
Here the parameters are shown in a nicer format:

```{r}
show_parameter_files(filenames)
```

The parameter settings used in this example are identical, 
except for their speciation completion rate and number of replicates. 

The experimental setup of this research has multiple steps, which we will follow closely here. 

These worked-out examples show the data produced in its raw form and does not care too much about aesthetics.

## Example 1: Weak protractedness

This example answers the question: what is the base level error of 
the analyses in this research?

The base level error can be obtained by using parameters for a 
constant-rate birth-death model. All tools used assume this model, 
but there will be noise (thus error) added in the process. 

The parameter settings of example 1 have a high speciation 
completion rate \lambda, which makes the constant-rate 
protracted speciation model fall back to a 
constant-rate birth-death model, 
as incipient species become good species (close to) instantaneously.

### Simulate one incipient species tree per parameter file

Here we simulate the 'true' incipient species tree:

```{r}
filename <- filenames[1]
testit::assert(is_valid_file(filename))
add_pbd_output(filename)
```

This is how the incipient species tree looks like:

```{r}
colors <- setNames(c("gray","black"), c("i","g"))
testit::assert(length(read_file(filename)$pbd_output$igtree.extant$tip.label) > 0)
phytools::plotSimmap(
  read_file(filename)$pbd_output$igtree.extant, 
  colors = colors
)
n_taxa_istree <- length(read_file(filename)$pbd_output$igtree.extant$tip.label)
```

There are `r n_taxa_istree` taxa in the incipient species tree. 
All taxa are good species, so the
edges of the phylogeny have only one color. The taxon labels are S[genus]-[species]-[sub-species]'. 

Now, we plot the nLTT plot of this phylogeny:

```{r}
nltt_values <- get_nltt_values(
  phylogenies = list(read_file(filename)$pbd_output$tree), 
  dt = 0.001
)
qplot(
  t, nltt, data = nltt_values, geom = "blank", ylim = c(0,1),
  main = "Example #1"
) + stat_summary(
  fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", color = "red", geom = "smooth"
)
```

Note that `get_nltt_values` is supplied a list of the one 
incipient species tree. This is because `get_nltt_values` 
works on a list of phylogenies.

### Once or more often, sample unique species from an incipient species tree. Also add an outgroup

From that incipient species tree, 
we create a species tree by sampling one individual 
per incipient species. Because speciation is for a 
constant-rate birth death model, there exist no multiple individuals 
per species. To being able to root our phylogenies in later steps, an outgroup is added as well.

```{r}
add_species_trees(filename, verbose = FALSE)  
```

Here we observe the sample species tree:

```{r}
plot_species_tree(filename)
plot_species_tree_nltt(filename, dt = 0.001)
n_taxa_sstree <- length(read_file(filename)$species_trees_with_outgroup[[1]][[1]]$tip.label)
```


In the sampled species tree, there are `r n_taxa_sstree` taxa,
where in the incipient species tree we had `r n_taxa_istree` taxa.

Note that in example #3, there will be multiple sampled
species trees. 

### Simulate one or more alignments per species tree

Knowing the evolutionary distances between species, DNA sequence alignments can be simulated fitting the species tree with outgroup. 
To do so, the parameters for sequence length and mutation rate are used.

Here we simulate one DNA sequence on our one sampled species tree
with outgroup:

```{r}
add_alignments(filename, verbose = FALSE)  
```

Note that this research assumes a simple Jukes-Cantor model, and does so as well in later steps.

Let's see the alignment:

```{r}
plot_alignments(filename)
n_taxa_alignment <- length(labels(read_file(filename)$alignments[[1]][[1]]))
```

In the alignment, there are `r n_taxa_alignment` taxa, 
where in the sampled species tree, there are `r n_taxa_sstree` taxa.

### Once or more often, let BEAST2 infer a posterior per alignment

With BEAST2 we can now obtain a posterior. A posterior consists of a representative sample of all possible trees (and parameter estimates), yet with more probable trees being present more often.

Here we let BEAST2 do so:

```{r}
add_posteriors(filename, skip_if_output_present = TRUE)
```

After running BEAST2 on our DNA sequence, the full posterior must be verified to be eligible for further analysis. Using Tracer, we can open the .log file generated by BEAST2, which has to be done manually.

It can be seen that the values for ESS (Effective Sample Size) are above 200 and that the trace log shows a well-mixed chain. An ESS of 200 is used as a minimum in this research. 

A posterior contains many phylogenies. 

```{r}
phylogenies <- extract_posteriors(read_file(filename))[[1]][[1]]
# To get the densiTree function working, phylogenies must be of class multiphylo
class(phylogenies) <- "multiPhylo"
```

Then, these posterior trees are plotted:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
densiTree(
  phylogenies, 
  type = "cladogram", 
  alpha = 1/length(phylogenies)
)
```

From this plot, it can be seen which phylogeny configurations
pop up most in the posterior.

### Compare original, sampled species tree, to the posterior

To refresh our mind, the true sampled species tree is:

```{r}
plot_species_tree(filename)
plot_species_tree_nltt(filename, dt = dt)
```

Now that the full posterior is assumed to be correct, 
first, I will now highlight one of its posterior states,
before going back to the full picture. 

In this case, I choose a random state to zoom in on. 
From this last state, I show the tree only:

```{r}
plot_posterior_samples(filename)
```

This random tree may be very different by chance, 
as unlikely trees are present, yet in low abundances. 

The original sampled tree is very probably different from this
random posterior tree.

How different then?

There are multiple ways to quantify this:

 * The gamma statistic
 * The nLTT statistic

#### The gamma statistic

The gamma value is a summary statistic described in [2]

First, I collect the gamma statistics from the species 
tree(s) with outgroup(s):

```{r}
true_gamma_statistics <- collect_species_tree_gammas(filename = filename)
knitr::kable(head(true_gamma_statistics))
```

In this case, there will be one statistics, as we only
have one species tree.

Then, I collect the gamma statistics from the posterior(s):

```{r}
posterior_gamma_statistics <- collect_posterior_gammas(
  filename = filename
)
knitr::kable(head(posterior_gamma_statistics))
```


#### The nLTT statistic

The nLTT value is a summary statistic described in [1]

First, I collect the nLTT values from the species 
tree(s) with outgroup(s):

```{r}
true_nltt_values <- collect_species_tree_nltts(filename = filename, dt = dt)
knitr::kable(head(true_nltt_values))
```

Then, I collect the nLTT values from the posterior(s):

```{r}
posterior_nltt_values <- collect_posterior_nltts(
  filename = filename, dt = dt
)
knitr::kable(head(posterior_nltt_values))
```

Last, I plot both of these:

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(
  data = posterior_nltt_values,
  ggplot2::aes(t, nltt),
  main = "nLTT plots"
) + ggplot2::geom_point(
  color = "transparent"
) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(
  limits = c(0, 1)
) + ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(
  limits = c(0, 1)
) + ggplot2::stat_summary(
  fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", size = 0.5, lty = "dashed",
  color = I("black"), geom = "smooth"
) + ggplot2::geom_step(
  data = true_nltt_values,
  ggplot2::aes(t, nltt)
)
```

How do we interpret these results? Well, even *if* we
follow all assumptions, this will be standard errors we
will make; this is the minimal level of imperfection.

Note that the error is not quantified only visualized. TODO: Issue #21





























## Example 2: Strong protractedness

This example answers the question: how do the analyses of this 
research look like for strong protractedness?

The pipeline is identical, except one parameter is changed: the speciation completion rate is set to a low value.
  
### Simulate one incipient species tree per parameter file

Here we simulate the 'true' incipient species tree:

```{r}
filename <- filenames[2]
testit::assert(is_valid_file(filename))
add_pbd_output(filename)
```

This is how the incipient species tree looks like:

```{r}
colors <- setNames(c("gray","black"), c("i","g"))
testit::assert(length(read_file(filename)$pbd_output$igtree.extant$tip.label) > 0)
phytools::plotSimmap(
  read_file(filename)$pbd_output$igtree.extant, 
  colors = colors
)
```

Now, we plot the nLTT plot of this phylogeny:

```{r}
nltt_values <- get_nltt_values(
  phylogenies = list(read_file(filename)$pbd_output$tree), 
  dt = 0.001
)
qplot(
  t, nltt, data = nltt_values, geom = "blank", ylim = c(0,1),
  main = "Example #2 incipient species tree"
) + stat_summary(
  fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", color = "red", geom = "smooth"
)
```

### Once or more often, sample unique species from an incipient species tree. Also add an outgroup

From that incipient species tree, 
we create a species tree by sampling one individual 
per incipient species. Because speciation is for a 
constant-rate birth death model, there exist no multiple individuals 
per species. To being able to root our phylogenies in later steps, an outgroup is added as well.

```{r}
add_species_trees(filename, verbose = FALSE)  
```

Here we observe the sample species tree:

```{r}
plot_species_tree(filename)
plot_species_tree_nltt(filename, dt = 0.001)
```

Note that in example #4, there will be multiple sampled
species trees. 

### Simulate one or more alignments per species tree

Here we simulate one DNA sequence on our one sampled species tree
with outgroup:

```{r}
add_alignments(filename, verbose = FALSE)  
```

Let's see the alignment:

```{r}
plot_alignments(filename)
```

### Once or more often, let BEAST2 infer a posterior per alignment

Here we let BEAST2 infer a posterior:

```{r}
add_posteriors(filename, skip_if_output_present = TRUE)
```

A posterior contains many phylogenies. To visualize these, 
they are extracted from a `.trees` file here:

```{r}
phylogenies <- extract_posteriors(read_file(filename))[[1]][[1]]
# To get the densiTree function working, phylogenies must be of class multiphylo
class(phylogenies) <- "multiPhylo"
```

Then, these posterior trees are plotted:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
densiTree(
  phylogenies, 
  type = "cladogram", 
  alpha = 1/length(phylogenies)
)
```

From this plot, it can be seen which phylogeny configurations
pop up most in the posterior.

### Compare original, sampled species tree, to the posterior

To refresh our mind, the true sampled species tree is:

```{r}
plot_species_tree(filename)
plot_species_tree_nltt(filename, dt = dt)
```

To quantify the difference between original incipient species
tree and posterior trees, the gamma statistic is used again.


#### The nLTT statistic

The nLTT value is a summary statistic described in [1]

First, I collect the nLTT values from the species 
tree(s) with outgroup(s):

```{r}
true_nltt_values <- collect_species_tree_nltts(filename = filename, dt = dt)
knitr::kable(head(true_nltt_values))
```

Then, I collect the nLTT values from the posterior(s):

```{r}
posterior_nltt_values <- collect_posterior_nltts(
  filename = filename, dt = dt
)
knitr::kable(head(posterior_nltt_values))
```

Last, I plot both of these:

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(
  data = posterior_nltt_values,
  ggplot2::aes(t, nltt),
  main = "nLTT plots"
) + ggplot2::geom_point(
  color = "transparent"
) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(
  limits = c(0, 1)
) + ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(
  limits = c(0, 1)
) + ggplot2::stat_summary(
  fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", size = 0.5, lty = "dashed",
  color = I("black"), geom = "smooth"
) + ggplot2::geom_step(
  data = true_nltt_values,
  ggplot2::aes(t, nltt)
)
```

How do we interpret these results? There is a big difference between
the 'true' nLTT and the inferred posterior its average nLTT, thus,
as expected, BEAST2 does worse at inferring phylogenies when
its assumptions (that speciation is instantanous) are violated.

Note that the error is not quantified only visualized. TODO: Issue #21

We cannot draw concusions yet:

 * the number of branches is too little
 * the number of replicates is too little

## Comparing example 1 and 2

Both examples showed a histogram of the error between 
true species tree and posterior trees. We expect these 
errors to have a different distribution: 
example #1 assumed instant speciation, which suits 
the algorithm best, where example #2 has a strong 
protractedness. 

It can be observed that these error distributions 
have a different median. This means that there is 
an observable higher error being made when the 
true species tree is protracted. 

This visualization does not tell use 
how the error is made: is the error concentrated 
at the root, middle or tips of the tree? 
To locate this, the average nLTT plots of 
the posterior is shown in figure :

In the next examples, we add replicates to the data.

## Example 3: Weak protractedness with replicates

Doing the rest:

```{r}
do_simulation(filenames[3])
do_simulation(filenames[4])
```

This example is an extension of the examples 1, with the differences that:

 * From the (same) incipient species tree, multiple species trees are sampled
 * Per species tree, multiple DNA alignments are simulated
 * Per DNA alignment, multiple BEAST2 runs are performed

### Incipient species tree

The first step is to simulate an incipient species tree. 
Because the RNG seed is at the same value as 
example #1, exactly the same incipient species 
tree will be obtained.

###  Species tree

It has little use to sample multiple species trees 
from an incipient species tree, as these are 
identical for instant speciation models. 
In this example, we do sample a species trees 
twice from the true incipient species tree. 
This results in two identical species trees.

### Alignment

From these (in this case identical) species trees, 
multiple alignments can be simulated. 
In this example, for every species tree, 
there are two alignments simulated. 
Because in this example, 
there are two species sampled, 
and every species tree has two alignments simulated, 
this results in four alignments.

Each alignment is different.

### Posterior

In this example, for each alignment, we do two BEAST2 runs, 
instead of one. It is expected (or: it should be the case) that both runs 
create a similar posterior. Because this example has 2 species trees, 
2 alignments per species tree and 2 BEAST2 runs per alignment, 
8 different-yet-similar posteriors are expected.

### Do posteriors contain paraphylies?

Never, which is expected, as there is no protractedness

### Seperate nLTT plots

Each its nLTT plot is compared to the original species tree, which is shown in figure [fig:Example-3-both-nLTTs]:

In all cases, we can observe that the lines are close, but do not match. 
Also this is expected, due to stochasticity in the MCMC sampling.

### nLTT plots of BEAST runs

To see how well the posteriors match, the nLTT plots of the BEAST runs are plotted in the same graphs:

### The BEAST2 runs appear to have converged to a similar posterior. 

nLTT plots of alignments

### Do the different alignments matter?

The different alignments do matter.

### nLTT plots of species trees

Do the different species tree matter?

A bit.

### Errors

For each tree in each of the posteriors, the error is put in a histogram as shown by figure [fig:Example-3-nltt-stats]:

But this does not tell us where the errors have been made: near the crown, 
near the tips, or in between? To do so, we plot the average nLTT plot of the posterior and compare it to the true species tree its nLTT, as shown in figure [fig:Example-3-posterior-average-nltt]:



## Example 4: Strong protractedness with replicates

This example is an extension of the previous examples, with the differences that:

 * From the (same) incipient species tree, multiple species trees are sampled
 * Per species tree, multiple DNA alignments are simulated
 * Per DNA alignment, multiple BEAST2 runs are performed

### incipient species tree

The first step is to simulate an incipient species tree. Because the RNG seed is at the same value as example #1, exactly the same incipient species tree will be obtained, as can be seen in figure [fig:Example-4-gene-tree]:



### Species tree

As there are multiple sub-species present for the same species, it makes sense to sample multiple species trees from an incipient species tree. In this example, we do sample a species trees twice from the true incipient species tree. This results in two different species trees, as can be verified by figure [fig:Example-4-species-tree].



It is a bit of bad luck that the random number generator picked two very similar species trees: would, instead of 

incipient species tree and all species trees

Doing this multiple times:



### Alignment

From these (in this case identical) species trees, multiple alignments can be simulated. In this example, for every species tree, there are two alignments simulated. Because in this example, there are two species sampled, and every species tree has two alignments simulated, this results in four alignments.

Figure [fig:Example-4-alignments] shows a visualisation of the simulated alignments of our example.



Each alignment is different.

### Posterior

In this example, for each alignment, we do two BEAST2 runs, instead of one. It is expected (or: it should be the case) that both runs create a similar posterior. Because this example has 2 species trees, 2 alignments per species tree and 2 BEAST2 runs per alignment, 8 different-yet-similar posteriors are expected.

Last tree

The last trees picked from the eight different posterior are shown in figure [fig:Example-4-posterior-sample-tree].



The species tree picked from the posterior all are different, but not too different (figure [fig:Example-4-species-tree]). 

### Do posteriors contain paraphylies?

Never BEAST2 creates monophyletic trees. 

###Seperate nLTT plots

Each its nLTT plot is compared to the original species tree, which is shown in figure [fig:Example-4-both-nLTTs].



In all cases, we can observe that the lines are close, but do not match. Also this is expected, due to stochasticity in the MCMC sampling.

### nLTT plots of BEAST runs

To see how well the posteriors match, the nLTT plots of the BEAST runs are plotted in the same graphs:



The BEAST2 runs appear to have converged to a similar posterior. 

### nLTT plots of alignments

Do the different alignments matter?



The different alignments do matter.

### nLTT plots of species trees

Do the different species tree matter?



A bit.

### Error

For each tree in each of the posteriors, the error is put in a histogram as shown by figure [fig:Example-4-nltt-stats].



But this does not tell us where the errors have been made: near the crown, near the tips, or in between? To do so, we plot the average nLTT plot of the posterior and compare it to the true species tree its nLTT, as shown in figure [fig:Example-4-posterior-average-nltt].



## Comparing example 3 and 4

Both examples showed a histogram of the error between true species tree and posterior trees. We expect these errors to have a different distribution: example 3 assumed instant speciation, which suits the algorithm best, where example 4 has a strong protractedness. Plotting both histograms in the same plot results in figure [fig:Example-34-both-nltt-stats]:



It can be observed that these error distributions have a different median. This means that there is an observable higher error being made when the true species tree is protracted. 

Because of the number of repeats, there are more data points, as all are lumped together.

This visualization does not tell use how the error is made: is the error concentrated at the root, middle or tips of the tree? To locate this, the average nLTT plots of the posterior is shown in figure [fig:Examples-34-posterior-average-nltt]:
