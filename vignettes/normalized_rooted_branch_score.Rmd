## Description

Calculate the normalized rooted branch score of trees.
This function compares pairs of trees.

## Usage

```normalized_rooted_branch_score(x, y)```

## Arguments

The arguments are two vectors ```(x and y)``` of an arbitrary length. Because the elements are branch lengths, no element should have a value higher than 1.

## Examples

```{r}
  tree1 <- c(1, 0.5, 0.7)
  tree2 <- c(0.4, 0.9, 0.5)

  normalized_rooted_branch_score(tree1, tree2)
```
And if not all branches are present in both trees:

```{r}
  tree3 <- c(1, 0.5, NA)
  tree4 <- c(0.4, NA, 0.5)
  normalized_rooted_branch_score(tree2, tree4)
```
